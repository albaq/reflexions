When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Whenever you are working with other developers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
   Could be that you are working on something that is not yet finished, so you don't want your code to be banished by an automatic pull.
